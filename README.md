# ml-from-scratch
Repo with implementation of basic machine learning models from scratch. Inspired by AssemblyAI's ML from Scratch playlist.

Models included:
 - K-Nearest Neighbours
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest
 - Principal Component Analysis
 - Perceptron
 - Support Vector Machine
 - Naive Bayes
 - K-Means

The code is based on the similar repository by AssemblyAI: https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
